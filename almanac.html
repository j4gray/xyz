This was confirmed by observations of the large plumes spewing from the sourhtern polar surface, determined to be mostly water, with a small amount of hydrogen molecutles. The exhaust from these jets (250 kg of water every second) is shot out at up to 2,189 km/h (1,360 mph), immediatley freezes in space, and is caputured by Saturn's gravity, forming the E Ring.

            Battery technology is becoming increasingly important as we consume power off the grid (whether in our phones/computers or electric vehicles) and right now they play a central role in renewable energy thanks in part to efforts by Tesla to commotize a self-sustaining in house electrical system. Here is an excellent primer.

 			<p> 
            One of the central unanswered questions in neuroscience is what gives rise to consciousness? It is also an issue that consciousness is not extremely easy to define and there are many interesting hypotheses dating back to <i>Cognito ergo sum</i> and other such classics of philosophy. Stephen Pinker has developed an interesting theory about consciounsess arising from synchronisity between neurons across brain functions.
