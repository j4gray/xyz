	<p>The relationship between humans and technology is currently undergoing a renaissance. Those who lived through the revolution of personal computing and remember the world before the internet will readily understand this but Ray Kurzweil made a crucial point in <i>The Singularity is Near</i>, which is that while we all may accept that the uptake and advancement of technology has exploded in recent decades the predictions that we inately harbor for the future may be skewed because they're based on the idea of linear progression. That is, we assume that technology will continue to advance at the present rate and our predictions for the future are based on the technologies of today. Kurzweil's fundamental thesis is that both biological and technological advancement are subject to The Law of Accelerating Returns and grow exponentially since the expanding realm of information and tools contribute to more refined development. It is difficult to imagine what is possible with information that is not yet readily available but Kurzweil is an expert at making predicitons and throughout the book he provided examples of research that have demonstrated feasibility in some of his more mindbending predicitons (like blood born nanobots remotely controlled through a Wifi connection). Most criticism he attributes to the 'intuitive linear' way of thinking.</p></br>

	<blockquote>
	<p>Many scientists and engineers have what I call "scientist's pessimism." Often, they are so immersed in the difficulties and intricate details of a contemporary challenge that they fail to appreciate the ultimate long-term implications of their own work, and the larger field of work in which they operate. They likewise fail to account for the far more powerful tools they will have available with each new generation of technology.</p>
	<p class="book_page">-pg. 12
	</p></blockquote></br>

	<p>Accepting the Law of Accelerating Returns in biology and technology, Kurzweil defined the exponentially increasing order of information into 6 Epochs of life of earth:</br>
		<ol class="epoch_list">
		<li>Physics and Chemistry = information in atomic structures</li>
		<li>Biology and DNA = mutable and transferable information</li>
		<li>Brains = pattern recognition and mental models of information</li>
		<li>Technology = evolution of simple mechanisms into computational and communication devices</li>
		<li>Merger of Human Technology with Human Intelligence</li>
		<li>The Universe Wakes Up</li></br><blockquote>
		<p> In the aftermath of the Singularity, intelligence, derived from its biological origins in human brains and its technological origins in human ingenuity, will begin to saturate the matter and energy in its midst. It will achieve this by reorganizing matter and energy to provide an optimal level of computation ... to spread out from its origin on Earth.
		</p></br>
		<p class ="book_page">-pg. 33
		</p></blockquote></br>

	<p>By tracking major paradigm shifts in biological and technological advancement Kurzweil showed that we are indeed advancing at an exponential rate. This concept is familiar in the computer age through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore's Law</a>, which is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years. This trend is not limited to computing power vs. cost, as Kurzweil showed all measures of recent technological advancment including, but not limited to, the Cost of DNA sequencing, the number of Internet Hosts, and the Decrease in Size of Mechanical Devices are advancing exponentially. In <i>The Singularity is Near</i>, Kurzweil attributed the entrance into Epoch 5 (Merger of Human Technology and Human Intelligence) to the rapid advances currently being made in three fields: Genetics, Nanotechnology, and Robitics (including Artificial Intelligence).</p></br>

	<p>The Merger of Human Technology and Human Intelligence will propel our species into a new age of evolution that is subject to the Law of Accelerating Returns. Although it is initally conceptually difficult to grasp the idea of implanting sophisticated technology into our bodies actually is the logical end result of biotechnology. These devices will allow us to overcome biological inefficiences (e.g. runaway replication that causes cancer, or aging). The foundational technologies in each of the GNR are alreay being developed including <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/289/5479/536.long">genetic profiling</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_therapy">gene therapy</a>, <a href ="http://www.foresight.org/Nanomedicine/Respirocytes.html">bloodstream borne nanobots</a>, and <a href="http://occm.de/roush1202.pdf">strong AI</a> capable of pattern recognition for diagnosing ECGs or flying auntomous weapons for the military.</p></br>

	<p>The Singularity is a future period when the pace of technological change will be so rapid that it appears as a vertical line on a graph. At that point, Kurzweil posited human life will be irreversibly transformed. He maintains that despite the risks, ranging from runaway nanobot replication or Gray Goo to the birth of a malevolent Artificial Super Intelligence, the Singularity doesn't represent the loss of biology to technology but rather a union that will allow us to transcend biological limits. Although it is fundamentally impossible to predict what life will look like after the Singularity, Kurzweil does an admirable job at describing a world that many may have thought was just the subject of Science-Fiction with calculated research and evidence so as to make it feel more like an inevitable future.</p></br>
