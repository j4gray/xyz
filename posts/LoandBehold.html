	<p><a href="http://www.loandbeholdfilm.com/">Lo and Behold</a>, narrated by Werner Herzog, is a journey through the birth of the internet through to its current integral role in society and into the future implications of the global network. Herzog skillfully navigated through interviews with experts in the field to lay out just how important the internet is today and how it evolved from a small community of academics into the millions of nodes that connect every part of the planet. It is easy to take the internet for granted when we are immersed in it everyday, but taking a step back to appreciate the vast transformation in the way we access information and the ease with which we are able to share ideas is astounding given the relatively brief period of time it took for this revolution to take place. The film is divided into ten chapters that trace the inception and implications of the internet:</p></br>

	<ol class="epoch_list">
		<li>The Early Days</li>
		<li>The Glory of the Net</li>
		<li>The Dark Side</li>
		<li>Life Without the Net</li>
		<li>The End of the Net</li>
		<li>Earlthly Invaders</li>
		<li>Internet on Mars</li>
		<li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
		<li>The Internet of Me</li>
		<li>The Future</li>
	</ol></br>


	<p>Herzog skillfully navigated interviews with experts in their respective fields whose excitement for the subject bursts through their technical descriptions. Joydeep Biswas, a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon, is building autonomous soccer playing robots and admits that the star - "Robot 8" - inspires deep reverence among the team even admitting "I love Robot 8." Biswas and his team were the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~robosoccer/small/">Robocup champions in 2015</a> and he has said that the goal of the programs is to create a team of automous robots that could beat the FIFA world champions. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Thrun">Sebastian Thrun</a>, formerly of Google now a researcher at Stanford University, also commented on the exciting future of Artificial Intelligence and autonomous agents.</p> </br>
		<blockquote><p>Whenever a self-driving car makes a mistake, automatically all other cars know about it including future unborn cars.</br>The ability of cars to develop AI is so much greater than the ability of humans to keep up with them.</p></blockquote></br>

	<p>Interconectivity is at the heart of the internet and as we become better and better at intaking information (with the assitance of AIs already embedded in the internet e.g. your spam filter) the power of what we are able to computationally accomplish has become astounding. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foldit">Foldit</a>, a game developed at the University of Washington that allows players to adjust the folding pattern of proteins through simple rules, is an astounding example of harnessing the internet to access the creative brain power of the masses through crowdsourcing. An interview with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson">Ted Nelson</a>, who coined the term 'hypertext' in 1963, also accentuated the interconectivity of ideas that is at the foundation of the internet and he demonstrated the ease with which the internet allows for citation and the rapid verification of information through links (basically the reason I love Wikipedia).</p></br>

	<p>The foundational interconectivity also makes some functions of the internet particularly vulnerable to attack or accident. Famous hacker, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Mitnick">Kevin Mitnick</a>, detailed how he was able to compromise the IT security of the FBI while he was under surveillance through simple social engineering tecnhiques whereby he targetted members of the phone company and pried them with bits and pieces of information until he found someone who he was able to con into giving him access to what he wanted. He accentuated that "people are the biggest security risk."</p></br>

	<p>Beyond security, which is becoming more and more crucial as our ever-increasing depenedence on the internet comes to include sensitive information or imporant functions (like driving your car), there is also a pending threat of solar flares which could pose to the infrastructure of the Internet itself wreaking havoc on our modern society. The Aurora Borealis are caused by small solar flares that are directed to the earth's magnetic poles but if the sun were to give off a significant amount of energy in the form of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejection">cornal mass ejection</a> (CME) it could cause a geomagnetic storm that would overload the power grid and damage transformers causing sweeping blackouts that would take out the Internet and reliant systems including air traffic control, electronically controlled municpial water supplies, optimization of food delivery, ATMs, etc. The last time a CME of this intensity occured was in 1859 during what is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_storm_of_1859">The Carrington Event</a> where auroras where reported as far south as the equator and ticker tape coming out of telegraphs (the internet of the day) burst into flames.</p></br>

	<p>The future of the Internet is still being written as it continues to expand to the farthest reaching corners of the globe and eventually out into space. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk">Elon Musk</a>, whose mandate to start a human colony on Mars, said that the Internet would play an integral role in communication within the colony. It's not difficult to imagine a world where everyone is connected to the interent but what is more difficult to answer is what will happen when all information (ranging from minutia as your music preferneces to macro-models of interstellar weather) is uploaded to the internet. Herzog addressed this extraordinary unknown by posing the question "Does the Internet dream of iteself?" (based on the Prussian war theoretician Clausewitz, who famously said Napoleonic times, "Sometimes war dreams of itself"). Sci-fi sceanarios withstanding, we should all take a moment to consider the mountains of information that invisibly fly by us daily and the extraordinarily small proportion of that information we are able to absorb in our lifetime, what would happen when we have devices that are able to directly interface with that information instead of relying on primitive visual or auditory methods of intaking information, what will our dreams look like then?
