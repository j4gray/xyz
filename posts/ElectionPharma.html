	<p>Hillary Clinton released a <a href="https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/statements/2016/08/24/hillary-clinton-statement-on-epipen-pricing/">statement</a> on Wednesday about the pricing of EpiPens, which has caused Mylan (the generics company that produces the branded EpiPens) to come under fire for their price hiking. Mylan raised the price of Epipens from <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/23/this-chart-shows-you-why-a-lot-of-people-are-angry-about-the-price-of-epipen.html">$100 in 2008</a> to $600 in 2016 without any innovations on the technology. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinephrine_autoinjector">EpiPens</a>, which administer dose of epinephrine or adrenaline to counteract severe allergic reactions through a safe auto-injection mechanism that can be used in an emergent situation, currently face no competition in the market and their realtively short shelf-life means that people who use EpiPens need to replace them every year. In response to the bad press, Mylan has announced the pre-emptive release of their authorized generic (an identical version that costs $300), which they normally would have rolled out after facing <a href="http://www.fiercepharma.com/sales-and-marketing/fda-swats-down-teva-s-epipen-copy-putting-mylan-cruise-control">competition</a> from another generics company.</p></br>

	<p>Clinton's attack on Mylan caused many Pharmaceutical and Biotech stocks to drop as people reasess some of the flaws in our current system that allow for high prices on technology that is not new or innovative. The scandal last year with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Shkreli">Martin Shkreli</a> and his company Turing Pharmaceuticals raising the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrimethamine#Availability_and_price">price of Daraprim</a>, an HIV drug, from $13.50 to $750 ignited public outrage and brought pharmaceutical pricing into the public spotlight making it a ripe area for campaigning polititicans to score political points (if you're interested I highly recommend Shkreli's <a href="https://twitter.com/MartinShkreli?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">twitter</a> page). However, in this political discourse there are a lot of key tennents of the pharmaceutical industry that are being overlooked. High prices are used to counteract the high costs of innovation to bring a drug from development, through regulation, to market. Paying high prices on drugs like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofosbuvir">Sovaldi</a>, which cures Hepatitis C at the sticker price of $100,000, is worth it because it is a distinct innovation by Gilead and offers a permanent solution to a previously chronic illness. Eventually when the drug goes off-patent Gilead will face competition from generics companies that will further extend the availability of their therapy but in that time they will have reinvested profits from Sovaldi into other novel therapeutics. This is the system of patents in the US that pays for innovation and makes the pharmaceutical industry lucrative enough to engage in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development#Success_rate">massive risk of drug development</a>.</p></br>

	<p>Companies like Mylan that produce generics help lower the cost of drugs and thus improve accessibility play an integral final phase of drug development that brings therapies to the masses. Villainizing them does not paint a clear picture of the challenges facing the American healthcare sector as a whole. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_drug_prices_in_the_United_States#Variability_and_non-transparency">Discrepancies in pricing</a> that are negotiated through insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers leaving certain consumers at a significant disadvanage paying exorbitant out-of-pocket costs and making many medicines unaffordable. The solution in the pharmaceutical industry will revolve around increased transparency of drug prices to allow for comprehensive negotiation and assurance that profits are being reinvested in innovation, whether or not that is a pre-existing entity like Medicare or a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2016/08/26/mad-about-epipen-here-are-some-ideas-to-actually-fix-americas-drug-pricing-mess/#30b604326b71">new negotiating power</a> remains to be seen as healthcare in this country undergoes a renaissance.</p></br>

	<p>Hillary Clinton tweeted a follow-up to her original statement that included a link to her comprehensive plan to combat unjustly high drug prices. Her solutions include: denying tax breaks for direct to consumer advertising and limiting to companies that show reinvestment in R&D, encouraging competition by expediting the approval process for generics and imported medicines, a Federal backstop for drugs that are facing no competition, a cap on out-of-pocket costs levied on consumers, and finally allowing Medicare to negotiate prices. Check out her tweet and read her plan:</p></br>
