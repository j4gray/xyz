	<p>The trek and the city were easily the most beautiful things I've ever seen in my life and literally, alitude aside, took my breath away. The group we were hiking with was an awesome crew composed of two other recent college grads from the University of Delaware, a junior from Middlebury wrapping up his semester abroad in Chile, a chick from Indiana who was on the final leg of her 10 month trip around the world, and a boistrous French Canadian man who provided most a constant source of entertainment. Our guide, Richard, had grown up in Aguas Calientes and was extremely knowledgable about every aspect of our surroundings including but not limited to the history, climate, flora and fauna, and indigenous culture. We also traveled with an extremely talented chef, John, his assistant, Martin, and a horseman, Asunci√≥n, who crucially coordinated the mules carrying our supplies. The food was definitely the among the best I had while traveling</p></br>

	<p>The climate changed quickly as we ascended the mountain and passed through the trail between Salkantay and Huamantay and descended back into the jungle. I had spent time acclimatizing and preparing for this trip but hiking in altitude comes down to a few things in my opinion. 1) Small steps and 2) Hiking sticks. Turn yourself into a a well pased quadrepedle and hiking is easy.</p></br>

	<p>The town below Machu Picchu, Aguas Calientes, is a hub for travelers visiting the Inca city. We woke up at 3:30AM to ensure our spot in line to visit the city as soon as it opened at 6AM. Arriving before sunrise we saw the city nearly deserted before the endless flood of tourists and we walked through the city reaching a vista to see the rising sun enter through the window of the Sun temple, positioned there deliberately to observe and predict the summer and winter solstices.</p></br>

	<p>After touring the city and learning the purpose and design of the various structures we parted ways with Richard and began the climb up the Mountain of Machu Picchu, which along with the peak of Huayna Picchu, provide the pass on which the city is built. This hike was by far the most challenging part of the 5 day trek with a seemingly endless series of stone steps which I had to conquer as a bipedle since hiking sticks are prohibited. The view from the top was well worth it as you could see the entire city from a birds eye view as if admiring a model in the museum.</p>
