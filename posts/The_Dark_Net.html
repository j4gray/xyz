	<p>The internet is arguably the most important tool we have ever created and thinking about the scope of it can be staggering. Most likely, you are just thinking about the indexed internet that is accessible with any browser, the one you use to send emails and read Wikipedia; however, there is an additional layer that makes up the interent which is unindexed, meaning it's not connected to the other nodes you're used to interacting with. Chances are you've heard of this layer, called 'the dark net' because of the use of it to sell and purchase drugs online with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)">Silk Road</a>. This is only scratching the surface of the capabilities of the dark net and whether you're interested in utilizing the services or not, it is a fascinating system and worth being aware of. Bartlett's book gives a tour of the dark net and its available services as well as insight into the people who built the corresponding software (including the minds behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a>) and those who utilize it.</p></br>

	<blockquote>
	<p>I have heard rumours about this website, but I still cannot quite believe that it exists. I am looking at what I think is a hit list. There are photographs of people I recognise – prominent politicians, mostly – and, next to each, an amount of money. The site’s creator, who uses the pseudonym Kuwabatake Sanjuro, thinks that if you could pay to have someone murdered with no chance – I mean absolutely zero chance – of being caught, you would. That’s one of the reasons why he has created the Assassination Market. There are four simple instructions listed on its front page:</p></br>
	<p>    >Add a name to the list</p>
	<p>    >Add money to the pot in the person’s name</p>
    <p>    >Predict when that person will die</p>
    <p>    >Correct predictions get the pot</p></br>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_market">The Assassination Market</a> may be hosted on an unfamiliar part of the net, but it’s easy enough to find, if you know how to look. All that’s required is a simple (and free) software package. Then sign up, follow the instructions, and wait. It is impossible to know the number of people who are doing exactly that, but at the time of writing, if I correctly predict the date of the death of Ben Bernanke, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, I’d receive approximately $56,000.<p></br>
	<p>It may seem like a fairly pointless bet. It’s very difficult to guess when someone is going to die. That’s why the Assassination Market has a fifth instruction:<p></br>

	<p>    >Making your prediction come true is entirely optional</p>

	</p></blockquote></br>

	<p>The book is separated into seven chapters that respectively address trolls, political free speech, Bitcoin, child pornography, Silk Road, live web-cams, and self-harm enabling chatrooms/social media. The key to these services is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)">Tor</a> or 'The onion router,' which repeatedly encrypts computer activity and routes it via several network nodes, called 'onion routers,' in order to make it untracable. It began as a US Naval Research Laboratory project and today exists as a not-for-profit organization that enables millions of people around the world to browse the internet anonymously and securely. Privacy online is becoming more and more of an important issue as we pour ourselves into our technology and while most of the topics covered in this book are nefarious in nature there are many mundane reasons to want to browse the internet without fear of surveillance. It is an interesting question to think about and I suggest <i>The Circle</i> by Dave Eggers (reviewed <a href="./The_Circle.html">here</a>) for a fictional look into what 0 online privacy could look like in the hands, not of a malicious tyranical corporation, but a tech company acclaimed for its social responsibility. At its core, <i>The Dark Net</i> is about what it is we humans use the internet for and why.</p></br>

	<h3 class="blog_header">Trolls</h3></br>
	<p>The practice of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_troll">trolling</a> or annonymously trying to abuse, intimidate, or provoke others online is becoming more and more prevalent and varies widely in practice from using offensive language to long-term cyberbullying that includes violent threats. It is now a fact of life that if you are in the public eye and have a Twitter account you have opened yourself to sustained sometimes vicious verbal abuse on your feed. The range of abuse reflects the range of trolls, or people writing inlammatory content online at any given time. Bartlett interviewed a troll in his early thirties named Zack who has been trolling for over a decade and said,</p></br>

	<blockquote>
	</p>“Trolling is not about bullying people, it is all about unlocking. Unlocking situations, creating new scenarios, pushing boundaries, trying ideas out, calculating the best way to provoke a reaction. Threatening to rape someone on Twitter is not trolling: that’s just threatening to rape someone.”</p>
	</blockquote></br>

	<p>The history of trolling is as old as the internet, dating back to heated discussions between academics on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">Arpanet's TALK function</a> in the 1970s (the precursor to e-mail). In 1978, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">Bulletin Board System</a> (BBS) became accessible with a modem, telephone, and computer and prompted more people to go online to look at the message boards. Insulting strangers, known as 'flaming,' had become commonplace within a year. By 1979, Duke University set up a new network called '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">Usenet</a>,' which was seen as for users that were ignorant or inexperienced by the prevailing Arpanauts leading to many heated discussions on message boards. Nevertheless, it gained popularity and in the early 1990s the number of internet users grew exponentially with them the available content of conversation. As the American lawyer and author Mike Godwin said in 1990 to describe the behavior on internet message boards, "As an online discussion grows longer, the probabiliy of a comparison involving the Nazis or Hitler approaches 1," or if you talk enough online it's guaranteed to get offensive. In addition to the flaming that had always existed, the rapid influx of users gave birth to a new form known as 'trolling.'</p></br>

	<p>Veterans of Usenet developed flaming tactics to identify new users by posting an urban myth about Usenet in the hope of eliciting a surprised reaction from newbies; this form of flamming was mentioned in 1992 in the group alt.folklore.urban as 'trolling.' As the internet continued to grow trolls diversified in both their goals and their methods eventually defined in 1999 on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt.*_hierarchy"><i>alt.*</i></a> as the 'straightup asshole flame troll,' the 'clueless newbie joke troll,' the 'hit, run and watch troll,' the 'confidence' or 'tactical troll,' the 'creative cross-post troll,' and the 'gang troll.'</p></br>

	

	<p>If the internet is about freedom of expression, trolling is about testing the limits of that freedom and it is baked into the system. When confronted with a troll the most obvious question is 'what are you getting out of this? How does it benefit you to provoke me?'' If the answer is to foster a discussion than that is possibly trolling at its best, unfortunately it is often just a sinister form of entertainment or as the catchphrase goes on /b/ 'I did it for the lulz.' It is also possible to use targetted trolling for even more sinister intentions. The recent election has shed a new light on state-sponsored trolling as it was a significant part of Russia's cyber operations against us. In addition to hacking and releasing emails from the Clinton campaign and DNC, Russia employed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections#Social_media_and_internet_trolls">hundreds of trolls</a> to crawl through comment sections of well-respected news sources and fill them with inflamatory partisan content. As we move forward identifying trolls and their motives will become a prerequisite for using the internet.</p></br>   

	<h3 class="blog_header">Bitcoin</h3></br>

	<p>Bitcoin is an aspect of the dark net that also achieved noteriety as a result of Silk Road and was largely seen as a means to an end of conducting transactions for illegal services. Additionally, it entered public discourse recently because the Winklevoss twins (or Armie Hammer x2) tried to start an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winklevoss_twins#Bitcoin">ETF for Bitcoin</a> allowing people to invest in it through the stock market. They were rejected and the only way to invest in Bitcoin remains downloading the software and buying a Bitcoin. For most people, that is still a tall order especially if they aren't interested in paying for services in an untracable way but the incredible innovation of Bitcoin lies under the hood and could very well shape the way everyone interacts with databases on the internet. Bartlett broke down system, called blockchain, that allows the annonymous transactions while simultaneously maintaining the a ledger to track movement of specific Bitcoins so they are not duplicated thus ensuring its value. He told the story of the development of this electronic crytocurrency from the source by interviewing the people who maintain it while shedding light on the motivations that drove its inception and upkeep.</p></br>

	<p>The role of cryptocurrency extends beyond paying for drugs or making a bet on the Assignation Market; Bitcoin is, as described by its creators, 'a political project' that allows individuals to conduct financial transactions without any central authority or middlemen. It began in 2009 on a emailing list for cytographers and quickly gained popularity, which drove the value up as the value of the currency lies in peoples desire to own it and use it, instead of the Treasury department of their Federal government. It is possible to exchange Bitcoin for dollars and as more people exchange it, the price goes up (from less than $0.001 in October 2009 to $100 in April 2013 to just over $1100 today). Maintaining the system is done by the Bitcoin Foundation but they are not by any means a central authority since they are not responsible for generating the ledger of transcations, which is done documented using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">blockchain</a></p></br>

	<p>Blockchain is a distributed system which allows for the paradox of simultaneous untracability and accountability of Bitcoin . They software works by storing a Bitcoin at an address, the key to which is just a unique string of letters and numbers and everytime it is transfered a record is written in the blockchain. 10 minutes' of transactions is roughly equivalent to 1 block and each block includes a hash (a digital signature) of the previous block. Thus blocks are chained together in a way such that they can only join if they start were the preceding one finished. A copy of the blockchain record (which includes every transaction ever made) is kept on the computer of everyone who has installed the Bitcoin software. This distributed network allows for continuous verification of the blockchain without a centrally controlled ledger. To maintain the integrity of the currency there is a cap of the total nubmer of Bitcoins that could ever be produced: 21 million (approximately 13 million have been created so far). New Bitcoins are 'mined' in very small amounts by people who compete for them by dedicating computing power to verifying the transaction of the blockchian. As more are created, the remaining Bitcoins require more computing power to mine (this is now done by data warehouses not individuals) and the last one is expected to be mined in 2140. Beyond currency, blockchain is a powerful tool for decentralizing the storage of a database and has far reaching implications from social media to clinical trials to scientific data; after all, dencentralizing data ensures it can never be deleted.<p></br>

	<h3 class="blog_header">Conclusions</h3></br>
	<p>The internet has shaped the modern world and as it will continue to grow and occupy a greater role in our lives it is important to have a general sense of what is on it, including in places that are hard to find. While I've only expounded on two chapters of the book, <i>The Dark Net</i> is an extensive tour through a world that is otherwise opaque. Bartlett navigated the intertwining histories of the internet and the radical libertarians who saw it as the tool by which to evade the tenticles of goverment through online anonymity, calling themselves '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk">cypherpunks</a>' to tell the story of how the dark net came to be. While I am not, at this time, interested in browsing the dark net, online privacy is only going to continue to be an issue to which there is no clear solution and I recommend this book for anyone looking for perspective.</p></br>
