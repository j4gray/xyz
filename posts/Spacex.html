	<p>Today <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7Uyfqi_TE8">Elon Musk presented</a> on the steps <a href="http://www.spacex.com/about">SpaceX</a> is making towards making humans a multiplanetary species, starting with a colony on Mars. This mandate was the original reason Musk started SpaceX in 2002 and the company has taken steps to revolutionize space travel technology, bringing costs down through vertical integretation of the rocket building process and their groundbreaking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_reusable_launch_system_development_program">reusable rockets</a>. Musk sees the colonization of Mars as a necessary step to ensure the survival of our species given the probability of an eventual existential event. Mars is the most suitable location in our solar system given its relatively short distance from Earth and comparable climate.</p></br>

	<p>In order to travel to Mars and bring people as part of a colonization effort, Musk pointed out that it needed to be an economically feasible option for people (comparing it to the cost of a house). This involves improving cost 5 million percent or 4.5 orders of magnitude, which Musk proposed through a series of technologies.</p></br>

	<ol class="mars_colony_list">
		<li>Full Reusability</li>
		<li>Refilling in Orbit</li>
		<li>Propellant production on Mars</li>
		<li>Picking the right propellant</li>
	</ol></br>

	<p>Key innovations include the orbital recharging that takes place in between rendezvous between Earth and Mars. The diagram of the system architecutre shows the potential reusability of each component - booster (1000), tanker (100), ship (12). </p></br>

	<p>This simulation of the Interplanetary Transport System shows what a trip to Mars would look like on their spacecraft. He accentuated that the trip would be fun.</p></br>

	<p>SpaceX has already made leaps and bounds in making space travel cheaper and they finance research and development by launching satelittes into low earth orbit and delivering supplies and scientists to the International Space Station. Musk said of his personal finances:</p></br>


	<blockquote>The main reason I'm personally accumulating assets is in order to fund this. So, I really don't have any other motivation for personally accumulating assets except to be able to make the biggest contribution I can to making life multiplanetary</blockquote></br>

	<p>Key advancements that SpaceX has already made in rocket technology are paving the way for interplanetary travel. By far the coolest is their propulsive landing system that allow boosters that previously were destroyed upon re-entry with Earth to land either on land or at sea onboard one of two droneships (<i>Just Read the Instructions</i> in the Pacific and <i>Of Course I still Love You</i>, named for sentient starships in Iain M. Banks' <i>Culture</i> series).</p></br>

	<p>When asked about the development of propulsive landing, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfJjx12wkVQ">Musk said</a>,</p></br>

	<blockquote>What we're tyring to do with the new crew Dragon design is be able to land propulsively with precision, which I think is the next generation. If you consider the first generation was parachutes to a water landing, then arguably wings and landing gear, then the third generation is propulsive landing with precision. I mean, if you saw a movie about the future with aliens landing - how did they land? Like that. Obviously, I mean it would be kind of weird if the aliens landed in the ocean with parachutes... It'd be like - ok, nothing to fear.</blockquote></br>
