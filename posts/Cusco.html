	<p>Cusco is an awesome city. It was the capital of the Inca empire from the 13th century to the Spanish conquest in 1532. Most of the structures built during this time were plundered for building materials by the Spanish however the foundations still exist throughout the city incorporated into colonial structures (including the Palacio de <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_Roca">Inca Roca</a> and <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coricancha">Qorikancha</a>). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_architecture#Masonry_and_construction_methods">Inca masonry</a> is extremely distinctive since they did not use mortar and meticulously sanded enourmous rocks into interlocking shapes to create structures that would withstand the frequent earthquakes.</p></br>

	<p>The center of the city is the Plaza de Armas a colonial decendent of imperial Cusco's central square called Haukaypata which was believed to be the center of the earth. Today, buildings in the Spanish colonail style line teh square including the impressive <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catedral_del_Cuzco">Catedral</a> and <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuzco#Iglesia_de_la_Compa.C3.B1.C3.ADa">Iglesia de la Compañía</a>.</p></br>

	<p>My plan while in Cusco was to spend a few days taking in the culture of the city then embark on a trek to Machu Picchu. I waited to hire a guide service until arriving since I had a flexible schedule and could shop around the multitude of agencies in the city. After connecting to Wifi over dinner I noticed my friend from school had just Instagramed a photo from Puno (250 miles Southeast of Cusco). I commented and asked if she was coming to Cusco, we got in contact and she said she was indeed traveling through Peru with her friend and they were coming to Cusco before embarking on the Salkantay Trek to Machu Picchu. Perfect. I asked what company and told her to let me know when she got to Cusco.</p></br>

	<p>The next day I walked around the city, venturing past the Plaza de Armas up to the artistic district of San Blas looping around to Colcampata, the site of the palace of the first Inca ruler Maco Cápac, atop which is now the church of San Cristóbal and affords a gorgeous vista of the entire city. There are alpacas wandering around all the major tourist sites, some accompanied by festively dressed women ready to pose for photographs and others roaming the ruins above the city. I learned that there are three types of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camelid">camelids</a> that were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_society#Food_and_farming">important in Inca society</a> (as well as Pre-Inca cultures): <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpaca">alpacas</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llama">llamas</a>, and fine haired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicu%C3%B1a">vincuñas</a>.</p></br>

	<p>In the afternoon I visited the various churches around the city and indulged in their various audio guides which provided excellent context for the colonial development of the city and the evolution of a distinct Cusquenian style amidst the sweeping changes made by the Spanish. The adoption of religious art and idols by indigenous artists gave birth to new unique conceptions of cannonical scenes like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcos_Zapata">The Last Supper</a>. I also went to the office of Salkantay Trekking and confirmed that the trip Ilana and Stella were doing was still available and booked it. We would be leaving in two days for five days of trekking the last of which was spent at Machu Picchu.</p></br>
