	<p>A few months ago, a good friend of mine asked if I wanted to go on a trip during Thanksgiving giving me the constraints that we had a week, we would backpack, and most importantly, relax in a setting of natural beauty. For Shana, my friend, there is no greater pleasure than finding a comfortable spot with a good view and posting up to read for hours on end. I selected Guatemala as our port of call because it is relatively close (< 3hrs from Houston by plane), relatively cheap, and bursting with ecological and cultural diversity. Shana and I met at the Houston airport and proceeded on to Guatemala City together. Upon landing, we arranged a shuttle to take us to nearby <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigua_Guatemala">Antigua</a>, the former colonial capital and tourist attraction.</p></br>

	<p>Antigua is charmingly easy to navigate with numbered Calles running North to South and Avenidas running East to West. After breakfast I left Shana contently reading at a rooftop cafe to explore the city. Heading south on 5 Avenida through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigua_Guatemala#/media/File:GT056-Antigua_Arch-low.jpeg">Santa Catalina arch</a> leads to the Parque Central where the center <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigua_Guatemala#/media/File:Plaza_central,_Antigua_Guatemala.JPG">fountain</a> includes mermaids spewing water from their breasts. On the east side of the plaza is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigua_Guatemala_Cathedral">Catedral</a>, which was built in 1670 and all but leveled by earthquakes in 1773. This is the common architectural feature of colonial structures in Antigua including the convent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_and_Convent_of_las_Capuchinas">Las Capuchinas</a>, the church of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Church_(Antigua_Guatemala)">San Francisco</a>, and the monestary of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santo_Domingo_Monastery">Santo Domingo</a>, which now hosts a luxury hotel and several small museums amind the ruins. The next day we continued on to Lake Atitlán.</p></br>

	<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Atitl%C3%A1n">Lake Atitlán</a> is the deepest lake in Central America and is rimmed by volcanoes and small Mayan communities. In the 1960s there was an influx of tourists, particularly hippies who settled in the towns of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panajachel">Panajachel</a>. We settled in the town of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Pedro_La_Laguna">San Pedro La Laguna</a>, which is small town mostly comprised of Tz'utujil Mayan people along with a small expatriate community. We settled into the wonderful <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g313833-d1103057-Reviews-Hotel_Maria_Elena-San_Pedro_La_Laguna_Lake_Atitlan_Solola_Department_Western_Highlands.html">Hotel Maria Elena</a> on the lake where we got a private room/bathroom with a hammock hanging outside our door for the bargain price of $13. Our first day we rented a kayak and paddled out on the lake (rather I paddled while Shana cruised in the front). Aside the occasional motorboat taking passengers from San Pedro to Panajachel or Santiago, we were completely alone on the lake, which was clear and calm.</p></br>

	<p>In the center of town (uphill from the dock easily reached by tuktuk) there is a small church with a statue of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Peter">San Pedro</a> himself in the plaza. The plaque beside the statue details his early life as a fisherman, putting him right at home on the shores of Lake Atitlán. One morning, while Shana slept, I woke up early and climbed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volc%C3%A1n_San_Pedro">Volcán San Pedro</a>. I enlisted a guide from a local agency both to ensure I got out of bed at 6AM and for general safety concerns. The view from the top of the volcano was extraordinary and with clear visibility it was possible to see the entire lake.</p></br>
