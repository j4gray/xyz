	<i>Ready Player One</i> by Ernest Cline offers a window into a fictional future where virtual reality has surpased base reality as the dominant economy and form of social interaction. 'The OASIS' (Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation) designed in 2012 by the eccentric James Halliday (who is a mix of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy_Wonka">Willy Wonka</a> and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Garriott"> Richard Garriott)</a> has by 2045 became a more viable economic option to physical travel. </p>
	</br>

	<blockquote>
	<p>At a time of drastic social and cultural upheaval, when most of the world’s population longed for an escape from reality, the OASIS provided it, in a form that was cheap, legal, safe, and not (medically proven to be) addictive. The ongoing energy crisis contributed greatly to the OASIS’s runaway popularity. The skyrocketing cost of oil made airline and auto- mobile travel too expensive for the average citizen, and the OASIS became the only getaway most people could afford. As the era of cheap, abundant energy drew to a close, poverty and unrest began to spread like a virus. Every day, more and more people had reason to seek solace inside Halliday and Morrow’s virtual utopia.</p>

	<p>The novel follows protagonist Wade Watts as he competes in the worldwide contest for Halliday's legacy through solving a series of riddles and tests leading to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)">hidden Easter egg </a> Halliday programmed before his death all of which surround his obsession with media from the 1980s when he grew up, amid the conception of videogaming and personal computing technology. Wade is an orphan with a talent for videogames and his experience with the OASIS from a young age was one of refuge and escape from difficult circumstances. Most important, in my opinion, are Cline's description of education powered by virtual reality. Wade attended school in the real world up until sixth grade when underfunding and crowding in the public school system had made virtual education a viable alternative. Through Wade's description, we see that for some students the experience was not only viable but indeed preferable</p></br>

	<blockquote>
	<p>All of my teachers were pretty great. Unlike their real-world counter- parts, most of the OASIS public school teachers seemed to genuinely enjoy their job, probably because they didn’t have to spend half their time acting as babysitters and disciplinarians. The OASIS software took care of that, ensuring that students remained quiet and in their seats. All the teachers had to do was teach.</p>
	<p>It was also a lot easier for online teachers to hold their students’ at- tention, because here in the OASIS, the classrooms were like holodecks. Teachers could take their students on a virtual field trip every day, with- out ever leaving the school grounds.</p>
	<p>During our World History lesson that morning, Mr. Avenovich loaded up a stand-alone simulation so that our class could witness the discovery of King Tut’s tomb by archaeologists in Egypt in AD 1922. (The day be- fore, we’d visited the same spot in 1334 BC and had seen Tutankhamen’s empire in all its glory.)</p>
	<p>In my next class, Biology, we traveled through a human heart and watched it pumping from the inside, just like in that old movie Fantastic Voyage.</p>
	<p>In Art class we toured the Louvre while all of our avatars wore silly berets.</p>
	<p>In my Astronomy class we visited each of Jupiter’s moons. We stood on the volcanic surface of Io while our teacher explained how the moon had originally formed. As our teacher spoke to us, Jupiter loomed behind her, filling half the sky, its Great Red Spot churning slowly just over her left shoulder. Then she snapped her fingers and we were standing on Europa, discussing the possibility of extraterrestrial life beneath the moon’s icy crust.</p>

	<p>Education and entertainment are ripe areas for development in virtual reality and Wade's experience gives a taste of that opportunity. In addition to the obvious benefits of the OASIS, Cline's vivid dystopic description of the world following a monopolization of virtual reality raises a multitude of questions about the current state of virtual reality and its future as it becomes a viable computing platform.</p>

	</br>
	<h3 class="blog_header">The Current State of Virtual Reality</h3>
	</br>

	<p>Virtual reality of the likes in <i>Ready Player One</i> (with full haptic feedback and seemless display) do not exist yet but focus on the development is already there and people can experience virtual reality today for a range of prices, starting at $30 for Google Cardboard and other smartphone powered headsets and going up to $800 to the high end consoles like Occulus Rift that run off of PCs or game consoles. There is currently an arms race in virtual reality development with no company emerging as Halliday's 'Gregarious Simulation Systems.'</p></br>

	<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality#Use">current applications</a> of virtual reality technology (besides its bedrock of videogaming) are in architecture and design, engineering, and training simulations</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNqs_S-zEBY">Elon Musk has implemented the use of VR </a>in conjunction with their 3D design technology to help engineers visualize and interact with their designs more effectively than 2D technology allows.</p></br>

	<p>Not mentioned in Cline's universe is the uptake of both Mixed reality (MR) and Augmented reality (AR), which have currently been the subject of interest after Magic Leap released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmdXJy_IdNw">video demo </a>of their MR technology. The difference between is that MR is a mix of the real world and virtual visualizations, the objects interact, whereas AR superimposes the virtual world without necessary concern with placement or interactions in the real world. This may seem somewhat arbitrary but only time will tell if they develop into distinct systems with different applications.</p></br>

	<p>Continued uptake in the videogame industry will be crucial to the continued development of VR and this will drive the cost for a quality experience down as applications continue to grow. Whether or not VR will replace PCs and smartphones as the dominant form of computer-human interaction is still up for debate but Cline's vision is a convincing argument for the inevitability of VR.</p></br>
