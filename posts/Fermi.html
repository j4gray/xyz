	<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox">The Fermi paradox</a> is one of the great mysteries of our time and I find that its simplicity makes it a great starting point to consider the role of humans in the universe. Our knowledge of the universe has rapidly expanded in recent years (pun intended) leaving us with some staggering metrics. Our sun is a star in the Milkyway galaxy, which contains 100-400 billion stars, and is just one of billions of galaxies in the observable universe. Extrapolating the math there could be as many as 100 billion billion Earth-like planets. How likely is it that Earth is the only one of these planets to give rise to life? Could it possibly be less that 1 in 100 billion billion? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a> did not think so and in 1950, while out to lunch with his colleges at Los Alamos, he asked “Where is everybody?”</p></br>

	<p>Stephen Webb has done a marvelous job of not only framing this question by it’s scientific explanations but providing a comprehensive survey of the evidence supporting various answers (and indeed answers that can provide no testable hypothesis but are interesting to think about none the less). Fermi’s question refers not only to why we have not been visited by extra-terrestrial visitors, who would require advanced technology to travel through space, but why we have received no sign of life anywhere in the galaxy. Given the vast age of the universe and the relatively short time it took for life to evolve on earth how likely is it that life evolved on some other planetary system in the galaxy billions of years ago giving rise to organisms subjected to hundreds of millions of years of evolution? Would that addition to the evolutionary timescale necessarily give rise to intelligent civilizations with technological capabilities far beyond our own? Of course it is impossible to know, but the gargantuan metrics of the size and age of the universe would appear to make the odds astronomical.</p></br>

	<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation">Drake equation</a> is an attempt to logically quantify these odds by estimating the number of communicating extraterrestrial civilizations in the Galaxy (N)</p></br>

	<p>The reason that I think the Fermi paradox is so interesting is that it forces you to consider the steps that allowed us to develop sophisticated methods for quantifying the universe and then subsequently wonder if it is possible that we are the only life in the universe capable of doing this. Whichever way your gut reaction leans, the implications are profound: either we are alone in the vast space of the cosmos, or we might one day have the opportunity to learn how life could develop under completely different evolutionary circumstances. Many great thinkers have considered these implications and sought to find logical conclusions. Webb separated these considerations into 3 categories:</p></br>

	<ol class="epoch_list">
		<li>They are here (Earth has already been visited by Extraterrestrials)</li> 
		<li>They exist but have not yet communicated (either for technological restrictions or sociological reasons like Star Trek’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Directive">Prime Directive</a>)</li>
		<li>They do not exist (the conditions on earth were so astronomically unlikely from the formation of the planet to the evolution of multicellular eukaryotic organisms)</li>
	</ol></br> 
	<p>The scientific explanations that support each of these respective conclusions range from the realm of fiction to sophisticated particle physics but Webb’s discrete 50 list of explanations allow us to navigate this spectrum and give weight to the evidence we find most convincing. Below is a sampling of Webb’s 50 Explanations that I found most compelling (or provocative as a thought experiment) with relevant links to the evidence he cited; if you are interested I highly recommend reading both <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Universe-Teeming-Aliens-WHERE-EVERYBODY/dp/0387955011">this book</a> and Tim Urban’s overview of the Fermi paradox on his blog <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html">Wait but Why</a>.</p></br>

	<h3 class="blog_header">They are here</h3></br>

	<ol class="fermi_explanations">
		<li><h4>4. They Exist and they are us - We are aliens </h4><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panspermia">pansperimia hypothesis</a>, posits that life exists throughout the universe and is distributed through contamination caused by the collisons between intrastellar bodies (like meteors, asteroids, comets and planets). The discovery of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Hills_84001">ALH84001</a> has led to the hypotheis that life as we know it originated on Mars and was transported in microbial form through a meteorite that collided with Earth.</p></li></br>

		<li><h4>6. The Interdict Sceanario</h4> <p>In 1933 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Tsiolkovsky">Konstantin Tsiolkovsky</a>, who proposed the theoretical basis for spaceflight and galatic colonization, famously said, "Earth is the cradle of intelligence but it is impossible to live forever in the cradle." He posited that advanced intelligences (millions of years ahead of our own) would be "perfect heavenly beings" who consider mankind not ready for visitation. Webb pointed out that this falls into the sociological explanation which must necessarily apply to every ETC in existence which calls into question the likelihood of universal motivations spanning hundreds of lightyears.</p></li></br>


		<li><h4>7. The Planetarium Hypothesis</h4> <p>This common occurance in science fiction is fun to consider. Credited to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Baxter_(author)">Stephen Baxter</a> and more famililarly known in the context of the 1999 classic, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix">The Matrix</a>, the suggestion that the world we live in is a simulation. The recent innovations in virtual reality (see my review on <i><a href="./Ready_Player_One.html">Ready Player One</i></a>) have indeed made it easy to consider a day when virtual simulations are indistinguishable from reality. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KK_kzrJPS8">Elon Musk has said</a> that with exponential advances in computing power these simulations will eventually be run on billions of devices so conversely the chances we are living in base reality (not a simulation) is 1 in billions. He also argued that this conclusion is desirable because if we do not develop simulations that are indistinguishable from reality it suggests a calamatous event that erases civilization and halts technological advance.</li>

	</ol>

	</br></br><h3 class="blog_header">They Exist but they have not yet Communicated</h3></br>

	<ol class="fermi_explanations">
		<li><h4>17. They are signaling but we do not know at which frequency to listen</h4><p>If we assume that ETCs would use electromagnetic waves to communicate we are left with the problem that the EM spectrum is extremely broad and radio frequencies alone cover 1MHz - 300Gz. Our own attempts to signal across interstellar distances (starting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Drake">Frank Drake</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Ozma">Project Ozma</a>) rely on the observation that clouds of neutral hydrogen (the simplest and most common element in the universe) strongly emit radiation at 1.42 GHz and the other ingredient in H<sub>2</sub>O: Hydroxyl radicals radiate at 1.64 so logically this range, the so called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_hole_(radio)">waterhole</a>" region of the EM spectrum (1.42 - 1.64 GHz) is the most likely way to signal to planets bearing water, a possible prerequisite for the formation of life. </li></br>

		<li><h4>27. A choice of catastrophes</h4></li><p>Even if the first 6 variables of the Drake Equation allow the frequent evolution of intelligent life, it is possible that a relatively small life span of such civilizations (L) means they never spend enough time attempting interstellar communcication for us to notice, in other words: Intelligent life has come and gone due to the inevitable self destruction. The methods of such <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophic_risk">self destruction</a> range from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_holocaust">Nuclear war</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotechnology_risk">chemical/biological weaponry</a>, self-replicating nanorobots (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_goo">Grey goo</a>), accidents in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_of_high-energy_particle_collision_experiments#Large_Hadron_Collider">experiments of particle physics</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runaway_climate_change">global warming</a> to simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_overpopulation">overpopulation</a> overwhelming the available resources.</p></li></br>

		<li><h4>28. They hit the Singularity</h4><p>Worth noting given my recent review of <i><a href="./Singularity.html">The Singularity is Near</a></i> by Ray Kurzweil. If technological advancement does indeed cause an "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_explosion">intelligence explosion</a>" and humans have access to superintelligent computational tools internally interfacing directly with the biological structure of the brain it follows that we would be able to more efficiently explore and colonize our Universe. As Webb puts it "the existenct of a Singularity does not explain the Fermi paradox. It exacerbates it!" <li>
	</ol>

	</br><h3 class="blog_header">They do not Exist</h3></br>
	<p>These explanations are all aspects of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_Earth_hypothesis">Rare Earth Hypothesis</a>, which argues that the origin of life and the subsequent evolution of biologically complex multicellular organisms (eventually yielding human intelligence) was the reuslt of a series of improbable astrophysical and geological events and circumstances, here are a few that I think are interesting to consider:</p></br>

	<ol class="fermi_explanations">
		<li><h4>42. The Moon is unique</h4><p>The size of the Moon relative to Earth makes it an exceptionally large satellite in our Solar system. Many of us know that the gravity exerted by the Moon is responsible for rasiing tides however this is not the most important function of our large satellite. The Earth is tilted at 23.5&#176 and this causes the dispersion of the suns energy and the changing seasons. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt#Oscillation">axial tilt</a> or obliquity of Earth oscillates about 1.5&#176 every 41,000 years, which is relatively small due to the stabilizing effect of the Moon (compared to Mars which lacks a large satellite causing the obliquity to shift from 15&#176 and 35&#176 every 100,0000 years).</p></li></br>

		<li><h4>44. The Prokaryote-Eukaryote Transition is Rare</h4><p>It is possible that millions of planets in the Galaxy host microbial life that never evolved into multicellular organisms. This required the necessary step from prokaryotic cells to eukaryotic cells that lack rigid cell walls and membranes allowing the mechanisms of phagocytosis and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote#Endomembrane_system_and_mitochondria">symbiotic relationships</a> between cells.</p></li></br>

		<li><h4>46. Technological Progress is not inevitable</h4><p>It is hard to imagine technological advancement ceasing now given, the exponential growth of computing technology easily exemplified by Moore's law but the humbling fact exists that we are the only species in the history of Earth that has created increasingly sophisticated technology. Webb presented the interesting story of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthal">Homo neanderthalensis</a></i>, which was a fellow hominid species existing with our own <i>Homo sapiens</i> 30,000 years ago. <i>Homo neanderthalensis</i> survived for over 100,000 years and while they did use tools, referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mousterian">Mousterian tools</a> (after the French cave they were first disovered), they do not exhibit significant technological advance from early to late examples.</p></li></br>

	</ol>

	<p>Reflecting on the implications of intelligence and the likelihood of it evolving under entirely different circumstances is a humbling experience. Since evolution acts without foresight and human intelligence was the random result of hundreds of billions of adaptive mutations, it's hard to imagine the convergent evolution of intelligence as we know it on another planet with even the most minute differences in astrophysical and geological climate. But for me it isn't difficult to imagine a course of conditions occuring over billions of years that lead to life in some form and as we continue to explore our solar system the search for evidence of life, even at the microbial stage will have massive implications for our species. Oxford University Nick Bostrum has <a href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/extraterrestrial.pdf">pointed out</a> that if we find evidence of past life on other planets like Mars it could spell out a pending catastrophic event that necessarily follows the genesis of life. Indeed Bostrum believes that in the context of the Fermi paradox, "the silence of the night sky is golden."</p>
