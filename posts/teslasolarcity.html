	<h2 class="blog_post_title">Tesla / Solar City merger</h2>
	<p class="blog_post_date">Jun 21 2016</p>
	<div class="blog_post_content">
	<p>Elon Musk has proposed a merger between his two publically traded companies, Tesla and Solar City, in a move that would create the first ever vertically integrated energy company. The compatibility of these two companies has come into question as the board considers the proposal (Musk, who sits on the board of both companies will abstain). Tesla is in the business of making automobiles and Solar City produces and installs solar panels in residences. People doubt whether these two industries are actually related enough to call for integration especially when both companies have yet to become <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-06-22/cars-batteries-and-dual-class-stock">profitable</a>. In the present climate of transportation dominated by gasoline these companies do seem like niche franchises that are attempting to make a dent in the global offset of carbon emmissions. However, looking ahead it is easy to see how a Tesla/Solar City merger would make the consumption of clean energy affordable and efficient enough to be the norm.</p>
	</br>
	<p>Tesla is already preparing for this future by installing a global network of charging stations for their vehicles that are powered entirely by solar panels. Elon Musk likes to joke that in the event of an appocalypse a Tesla would be a highly feasible form of transportation since you wouldn't have to loot a gas station for fuel because Tesla charging stations are free to use and self-sustaining on solar power (this is assuming that the appocalyptic situation did not block out light from the sun as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix#Plot">The Matrix</a> where humans polluted the atmosphere in an attepmt to staunch the machines abundant energy source, which ultimately made them turn to the human body itself as a source for energy). Tesla is constantly expanding their network of charging stations and to do so they need a massive supply of solar panels, which to me makes the acquisition of Solar City an obvious move to further their end goal of a completely green network of transportation. </p>
	</br>
	<p>The other challenge facing both companies, besides the needed improved efficiency of harvesting solar energy, is how to store it. Solar energy is converted into electrical energy and stored in a battery, these batteries are then used to power anything from a flashlight, to a car, to a home. The problem is that in order to store enough power to accomplish the latter two feats you need a lot of batteries. That is the current production problem with Tesla cars and it is why they are building the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigafactory_1">Gigafactory</a> since in order to produce their target number of automobiles they would consume the entire existing market of batteries. The gigafactory is poised to play an extremely important role in a vertically integrated energy company because it can easily service both cars and residences (Tesla also sells a <a href="https://www.teslamotors.com/powerwall">home battery</a> that can be used with Solar City panels to store energy).</p>
	</br>
	<p>The merger seems like an obvious move to me when considering the energy landscape of the future. Our consumption of oil is obviously not sustainable and here we have two companies offering a viable option for clean energy in both transporation and residential living. They use complementary technologies (solar panels and batteries) that should be mass manufactured to make the cost of switching to a completely carbon neutral way of life a viable option for the population. The financial standpoint (which my brother explained to me) is absolutely a necessary consideration as Solar City carries a lot of debt which Tesla would take on right at the time when they need to raise capital to bring the <a href="https://www.teslamotors.com/model3">Model 3</a> (their attempt at an afforable electric car) to market. But, for me, my faith in Elon Musk's vision outweighs these concerns. <a href="https://www.teslamotors.com/about">Tesla </a>was founded to accelerate the uptake of sustainable energy and they have consistently shown their commitment to this mission over producing the best possible balence sheet for shareholders (as evidenced in 2014 when they <a href="https://www.teslamotors.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you">open sourced their patents</a> to assist others in developing clean energy technology). Tesla stock has soared nonetheless and it's because people believe in Elon Musk's mission and furthermore his ability to make it a reality. I am hopeful that someday soon clean energy won't be a part of the vernacular because we've elimated energy sources that emit carbon into our atmosphere. </p>
