	<p>This book is an excellent story that questions what role internet privacy has in our lives, which is becoming more and more a topic of discussion. I have been talking a lot about web privacy recently because of congress' <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/technology/congress-moves-to-strike-internet-privacy-rules-from-obama-era.html?_r=0">recent decision</a> to upturn legislation that would have prevented internet service providers (ISPs) to sell consumers data. This may seem inconsequential, indeed when the topic is broached and I voice concern for privacy online most of my friends simply respond "What are you doing on the internet that you're trying to hide?" It's more than likely that this data will simply be used for targetted advertising, which I am in support of when it's done right (i.e. I don't get the same ads over and over again), but there is a dark underbelly wherein it's possible to mine data and funnel it into predictive algorithms not to determine shopping habits but health status or likelihood to commit a crime. When it works, it's great and I am in support of law enforcement using surveillance but where do we draw the line in the name of privacy for the public? It is in this gray area that <i>The Circle</i> positions itself with a narrative of what a world without internet privacy may look like. Through a monolithic tech corporation, The Circle, aimed at, among other vague and widereaching albeit socially responsible projects, total surveillance and transparency through their technology. The system is the brainchild of Ty Gospodinov and is eloquently described in the first few pages.</p></br>

	<blockquote>
	<p>Ty had devised the initial system, the Unified Operating System, which combined everything online that had hertofore been separate and sloppy—users' social media profiles, their payment systems, their various passwords, their email accounts, user names, preferences, every last tool and manifestation of their interests. The old way—a new transaction, a new system, for every site, for every purchase—it was like getting into a different car to run any one kind of errand. “You shouldn’t have to have eighty-seven different cars,” he’d said, later, after his system had overtaken the web and the world.</p>
	<p>Instead, he put all of it, all of every user’s needs and tools, into one pot and invented TruYou—one account, one identity, one password, one payment system, per person. There were no more passwords, no multiple identities. Your devices knew who you were, and your one identity—the TruYou, unbendable and unmaskable—was the person paying, signing up, responding, viewing and reviewing, seeing and being seen. You had to use your real name, and this was tied to your credit cards, your bank, and thus paying for anything was simple. One button for the rest of your life online.</p>
	<p>To use any of the Circle’s tools, and they were the best tools, the most dominant and ubiquitous and free, you had to do so as yourself, as your actual self, as your TruYou. The era of false identities, identity theft, multiple user names, complicated passwords and payment systems was over. Anytime you wanted to see anything, use anything, comment on anything or buy anything, it was one button, one account, everything tied together and trackable and simple, all of it operable via mobile or laptop, tablet or retinal. Once you had a single account, it carried you through every corner of the web, every portal, every pay site, everything you wanted to do.</p>
	<p>TruYou changed the internet, in toto, within a year. Though some sites were resistant at first, and free-internet advocates shouted about the right to be anonymous online, the TruYou wave was tidal and crushed all meaningful opposition. It started with the commerce sites. Why would any non-porn site want anonymous users when they could know exactly who had come through the door? Overnight, all comment boards became civil, all posters held accountable. The trolls, who had more or less overtaken the internet, were driven back into the darkness.</p>
	<p>And those who wanted or needed to track the movements of consumers online had found their Valhalla: the actual buying habits of actual people were now eminently mappable and measurable, and the marketing to those actual people could be done with surgical precision. Most TruYou users, most internet users who simply wanted simplicity, efficiency, a clean and streamlined experience, were thrilled with the results. No longer did they have to memorize twelve identities and passwords; no longer did they have to tolerate the madness and rage of the anonymous hordes; no longer did they have to put up with buckshot marketing that guessed, at best, within a mile of their desires. Now the messages they did get were focused and accurate and, most of the time, even welcome.</p>

	<p>I love when fiction adds to a debate by presenting the most extreme case, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum">reduction to adsurdity</a> in logic (i.e. <i>1984</i> or <i>Brave New World</i>), and Eggers does an excellent job of framing the problem as a masked series of solutions. There are many parts of The Circle's technology that are attractive for interent consumers and the description of the company doesn't put it that far off of Silicon Valley tech giants like Google or Facebook. Indeed, the technology seems like a chimera of the two companies with the ultimate goal of monopoly on internet browsing.</p></br>

	<p>When I was a senior at Northwestern, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_R._R._Martin">George R. R. Martin</a> (an alum of the Medill School of Journalism) came to speak. As an avid fan of both the HBO series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones">Game of Thrones</a> and the underlying epic series <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></i>, I obviously went and listened with rapt attention. He said something interesting that has provided a useful lens for thinking about Sci-fi and fantasy ficiton. He said that Sci-Fi and Fantasy are two sides of the same coin and as someone who had been living in that universe since the 1970s he has witnessed a profound change in the genre. Early in his career, Sci-fi and Fantasy were largely defined by the briming optimism of technology and 'the world of tomorrow.' This slowly shifted and today the genre is dominated by apocalyptic literature or the existential threats that humans are brewing to destroy themselves. Using this lens to think about fiction helps contexualize the message and in the case of Eggers' <i>The Circle</i> identify the paradox of these themes, which is that we will continue to opt into techology that improves the efficiency our daily lives and brings us closer to the possible 'world of tomorrow' up until the point it destroys us.</p></br>

	<p>The technology that The Circle develops at their palatial futuristic campus in Silicon Valley is basically a web interface (despite the early refernce to the software as an Operating System), one that allows for the seamless upload and analysis of user data. The result of such efficient data collection in turn provides benefits for both the user and society, in the form of precision medicine and widespread global connectivity. The cast of characters that make up the leadership of the company reflect the competing corporate motivations for developing an internet system that essentially uses consolidation of user data as a means of surveillance. In addition to Ty, who is described as "at best, socially awkward, and at worst an utter interpsonal disaster," the company is run by the outgoing and enigmatic Eamon Baily, who serves as the face of the company expounding the social justice implications of complete accountability through the internet, and the ruthless money man Tom Stenton who relishes in the power granted to the keeper of all this data, particularly to change it as a means of blackmail; together they form the "three wise men" that lead the company. Ty is noted be extremely reclusive, which is a beautiful paradox at a company whose self-professed goal is transparency, appearing again and again as a symbol: from the all-glass circular campus to the network of miniature cameras they use to establish a global public network of survailance (dubbed 'SeeChange').</p></br>

	<p>The protagonist, Mae, is a new recruit to The Cirlce and as she navigates the self-contained ecosystem of the vast company we are slowly introduced to the underlying strucutre and philosphy. Mae's job may seem overly trivial at first, she seems to be working as a customer service hotline but eventually at the prodding of her superiors she starts participating so actively in the social media ecosystem of the company that she seems to be paid for producing content. The stark presentation of a world without privacy, explored through characters of varying ages and opinions, including but not limited to Mae's parents and her philosophical and neo-Luddite ex-boyfriend who is given the role of calling out the ridiculousness of the total transparency through the internet that Mae comes to find herself the poster child for. Mae herself is blinded by the shallow self-validation that the company uses to extract user data (this is in interesting phenomenon that has been studied in software products and apps developed today known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification">gamificaiton</a>). It isn't long before she is seduced by Eamon's utopic vision of global survailance enabling total accountabilty and she is spouting taglines like <i>PRIVACY IS THEFT</i>. This book is an updated and refreshing take on the Orwellian dystopia of total surveillance. Egger's thoughtfully reminds us that we will not succumb to technology because of devastation of war drives the rise of a fascist government but more likely we will continue to develop tools that we perceive as improving our quality of life, which eventually will seamlessly concentrate power in the hands of a tiny fraction of humanity leaving the vast majority of the population subjugated by the very technology the perceived as extraordinarily helpful.</p></br>

	

	<p>The book is being made into a movie starring Emma Watson the trailer looks excellent.</p></br>
