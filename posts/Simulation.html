	<p>I have been interested with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis">simulation hypothesis</a> for a couple months now. Besides viewing The Matrix when I was a child, the topic was seriously brought to my attention by Elon Musk when he was asked at the <a href="http://www.recode.net/code-conference-2016">2016 Recode Code Conference</a> if we were currently living in a computer simulation. His answer was quintessential Elon Musk where he breaks a seemingly complex idea into it's constituent arguments and logically follows them leading to a conclusion that then seems obvious. He argued that given the progression of videogames in the past 40 years from <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong">Pong</a></i> to the photorealistic 3D renderings we have today you can easily imagine a future where we have videogames that are indistinguishable from reality. If these simulations are being run on consoles and personal computers then there would be billions of times as many simulated consciousnesses (sims) as biological organisms in base reality. The logic follows that the chance we are not in computer simulation is less than 1 in billions. The converse of this argument is that humans will never reach this compuational capacity, which Musk pointed out means something existentially catastrophic has happened to the human species that has caused technological advancement to cease, or put more simply, either we're going to create simulations indistinguishable from reality or civilization will cease to exist.</p></br></br>

	<p>The argument for the idea that we are in fact living in a computer simulation was articulated beautifully by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bostrom">Nick Bostrum</a>, English philospher and author of <i>Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers and Strategies</i>, who put forward a trilemma that concisely explains why so many smart people have been increasingly questioning whether we are in base reality as it appears. The trilemma relies on the assumption that our technological advancement will continue at the exponential pace we have been on (see my <a href="./Singularity.html">post</a> on <i>The Singularity is Near</i>) and therefore at some point our species will reach a level of computing capability that allows us to run complex simualtions down to the molecular level. You can already imagine this happening today on a small scale, if we don't know how rising sea levels will effect the global climate we program in the relevant physics and run a simulation to model the weather. So if this "post-human" civilization can run the computations necessary to create a simulation that is indistinguishable from reality (as it seems we are on the trajectory to do) then we must face Nick Bostrum's trilema that one of the following must be true:</p></br>

	<ol class="epoch_list">
		<li>The fraction of civilizations that reach a stage that has the computational capacity to running high-fidelity ancestor simulations is very close to 0</li>
		<li>The fraction of post-human civilations that are interested in running ancestor simulations is very close to 0</li>
		<li>The fraction of all people with our kind of experiences that are living in a simulation is very close to 1</li>
	</ol></br>

	<p> In other words, we must accept that either post-human civilzations don't exist, or for whatever reason they are uninterested in running ancestor simulations (maybe it is deemed unethical to 'imprison' consciousness in a simulation), or finally that we are in fact in a simulation. If in fact humans ever reach the computational capacity to run high-fidelity simulations then the sims that would be engaged at any given moment would exponentially outnumber the total number of actual ancestors so the chance we are not actually among those sims is exponentially small. As Nick Bostrum elloquently put it,</p></br>

	<blockquote><p>If we don't think we are currently living in a simulation, we are not entitled to believe that we will have descendants who will run lots of such simulations of our forebears</p></br><p class ="book_page"><i><a href="http://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html">- Are you living in a computer simulation?</a></i> (2003)</p>
		</p></blockquote></br>

	<p>Other than being a huge mindf*ck and impossible to come up with a counterargument to, this hypothesis has been on my mind more and more lately because of the increasingly strange nature of our reality. This nagging feeling started after the election when we elected a reality TV star/hotelier to be the Leader of the Free World and recently popped into my head after the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KeOxeuiZjs">legendary mixup</a> that occured at this year's Oscars when they announced the wrong movie for Best Film. I was watching live and immediately texted my friend Shana (who is depicted in the cartoon above) to see if she was watching and share my intense feeling that this incident just further confirmed we are in a computer simulation. I mean come on, how could all this shit be happening unless we are in fact in a twisted version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Empires">Age of Empires</a> with an option to elect a clown to the highest office just to see what would happen?</p></br></br>

	<p>[This sentiment was shared by New Yorker writer Adam Gopnik who wrote a <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/did-the-oscars-just-prove-that-we-are-living-in-a-computer-simulation">dope article</a> about it]
